This is a simple program created by request to extract specific metadata for music LPs from OCLC. It uses PHP, DOM/XPATH, and JavaScript.

The copy/paste feature may not work in current versions of Chrome.

For example, try OCLC # 437606272 to display metadata for a 1976 LP release of John Coltrane's "Giant Steps."

If you'd like to contribute to the project, possible enhancements would include compatability for non-English characters; additional metadata fields (or a drop-down list of possible fields); or an enhanced style or UI.
